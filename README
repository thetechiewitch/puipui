IPv4 stack with ICMP-Ping and ARP capabilities, written in modern C++, interfacing the ESP8266 flashed with the 
raw-ethernet frame forwarding firmware found under https://gitlab.com/goodwin-europe/raw-esp.

The serial interface used to transfer the raw frames is connected to the ESP8266's ´RX0/TX0´.

Configured to connect to a WiFi station with a static IPv4 configured in ´iface_config.h´, and act as a server.
The WiFi name and password are stored in ´wifilogin.h´.

Code to scan for WiFi networks and to retrieve the board's MAC address is provided commented out in ´main.cc´.


Build
-----

Tested on macOS but should run with minor modifications on Linux.

To build, run: ´make´.


Run
---

To run the system, connect your ESP8266 board and prepare your serial interface to be able to connect to it.

Once the system is started, it will connect to the configured WiFi access-point and wait for ICMP Ping requests.
